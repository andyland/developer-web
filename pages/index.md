### What This Is ###
The TuneWiki API aims to make it quick and simple to start including lyrics and other 
TuneWiki social data into your application or website.

### How It Works ###
The TuneWiki API implements a RESTful api for the different resources we provide.  Any REST
client should have no problem consuming our API, but we also provide SDK's for popular 
programming languages on our [Github Page](http://github.com/tunewiki).  Stay tuned
as we continue to add SDK's and resources!
  
### Get Started ###
First you'll need to [Get Access]({{base_url}}/api/getting-access) then you'll want
to brush up on some documentation.  You're probably here for the lyrics, so check out
the documentation for the [Lyrics Resource]({{base_url}}/api/resource/lyrics)
