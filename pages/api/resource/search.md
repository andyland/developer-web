#### Types of searches you can perform:
The following are valid values for the `type` parameter on the request  

1. `lyrics` - match a phrase from the lyrics of a song
1. `songs` - match a song name (do not include the artist name in your query)
1. `artistsongs` - match a song name (DO include the artist name in your query).  This is more accurate than a bare `songs` search.
1. `artists` - match an artist by name
1. `hashtags` - match shares based on a hashtag (example #templatetuesday)
1. `shares` - match shares based on any word in the comment.
